Description

	Replacement for urlview to parse URL links from mail messages.

	This is designed primarily for use with the mutt emailer. The
	idea is that if you want to access a URL in an email, you pipe
	the email to a URL extractor (like this one) which then lets
	you select a URL to view in some third program (such as
	Firefox)

Dependencies

	MANDATORY (these usually come with Perl):

	MIME::Parser
	HTML::Parser

	OPTIONAL:

	URI::Find
	- recognizes more exotic URL variations in plain text (without
	  HTML tags)

	Curses::UI
	- allows it to fully replace urlview

	Getopt::Long
	- if present, extract_url recognizes long options -version and
	  --list
